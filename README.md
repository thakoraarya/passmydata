### `what does this project do?`

you see 4 buttons from 2 child components in blue color

then you see a green chip displaying ** no child data here ** at initial


### what happens is that 

when you will click on the button the chip wil be updated with new data

### for nerds

the blue buttons are 2 childs and the greeen chip is parent 
basically I'm passing data from child to parent and update parent from child.



for more such micro features keep in touch.
